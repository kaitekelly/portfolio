Kaite Kelly's Portfolio website
This is Kaite Kelly's responsive portfolio site. It is made developed using Bootstrap components. 
There is a main page with an About me bio that explains a little about me. 
There is a portfolio page that will hold my coding projects with direct links to the deployed project page and a link to the repository on github. The images that are currently in there are placeholder images. 
The final page is a contact page that has a form to message me.
